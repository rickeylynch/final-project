            <h3> Hawaiian Adventure</h3>
            The allure behind Hawaii held true. I believe everyone  should go to Hawaii, at least once in their life. Between the numerous aquatic activities, lush green scenery, and the stunning golf courses, and a plethora of other things, there is something for everyone to enjoy. While we were there we went whale-watching and luckily enough, it was whale season. The weather was perfect for it, and I got some great views like the one to the left. Click the picture to book your own adventure! But dont just take my word for it. Check out the video below if you are still not convinced!
